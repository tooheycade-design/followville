# FOLLOWER NEIGHBORHOOD — project memory (read me first)

Cade's Instagram project: a persistent 3D low-poly town in Blender. Every follower = a house.
Daily reels show the town growing. THE CITY'S MEMORY IS world_state.json — NEVER edit/delete
it casually; back it up before risky operations.

## Current canon (update this section each day!)
- Day 4, population 14, 15 buildings. Sunset fireworks marked the founder era complete.
- Web viewer shipped day 4 (index.html + town.glb, see Web viewer section).
- FOUNDERS (first 10 residents, custom houses, all built):
  1 mushroom  2 casino  3 cat  4 castle  5 Eiffel home  6 hydrangea flower
  7 Burj Khalifa  8 giant toilet (next to Burj, faces east)  9 beach house  10 cottage
- Founder district = blocks around the center. Regular houses NEVER build in blocks
  containing custom houses (enforced in code).

## Daily workflow (Terminal, no Blender GUI needed)
  cd ~/Documents/neighborhood
  ./grow.sh +N --render              # N followers gained -> N houses + video
  ./grow.sh -N | "=TOTAL" | replay   # losses / set total / re-animate
Flags: --special TYPEhouse[@gx,gy] --followers N --hero --celebrate
       --cam overhead --tag NAME --time day|sunset|night --season X --still
Videos auto-copy to Desktop. Multi-shot days: hero shot (replay --hero --render --tag hero)
+ overhead/final (+0 --cam overhead --render --tag overhead).

## House-facing rules
- Houses auto-face their nearest road. Override: set "face": "s|e|n|w" on the building
  in world_state.json (camera looks from the SOUTH-EAST: s and e faces are visible).

## Adding custom house models (Fable-level work)
Edit neighborhood_blender.py: write build_X_house() using add_box/add_ngon_cone/
add_prism_roof + mat(), register in SIZE and ASSET_VARIANTS, then
--special xhouse[@gx,gy]. Match the cute pastel style. After script changes run:
  /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background neighborhood.blend --python _refresh_text.py

## Cost discipline
- ONE preview still per day max (--still), then render.
- Renders take 10-15 min each: run via nohup job writing render_log.txt (ends "ALL_DONE"),
  and hand the log-watching to a HAIKU subagent. Never poll with the expensive model.
- Routine +N days need no preview at all.

## Web viewer (index.html + town.glb)
A first-person browser version of the town lives in index.html, next to world_state.json.
Real geometry, not a hand-ported copy: grow.sh now runs export_web.py (a second headless
Blender pass) after every build, which bakes the actual "WORLD" collection Blender just
built to town.glb (realizes collection-instances to real meshes via duplicates_make_real,
then exports GLB, Y-up, no animation/camera/lights). index.html loads town.glb with
Three.js's GLTFLoader — pixel-for-pixel the same model Blender rendered, no drift, no
manually-ported shapes to keep in sync, and any brand-new custom house type in
neighborhood_blender.py "just works" on the web the next time grow.sh runs, zero web-code
changes needed. world_state.json is still fetched separately, just for the day/population
HUD text. Collision colliders are computed automatically from each top-level object's
bounding box in the loaded GLB — no per-house-type radius to maintain either.

Fallback: if town.glb is missing (e.g. before the first export ever ran), index.html falls
back to an OLDER procedural JS approximation (the BUILDERS map, ~line 160-500) that
hand-rebuilds simplified house shapes from world_state.json alone, no Blender needed. This
is a safety net only — it's visually approximate and NOT kept in sync with new Blender
house types. Prefer fixing/regenerating town.glb over touching the JS builders.

Serve via a local server (`python3 -m http.server` in this folder — fetch() needs http://,
not file://) or deploy the folder as a static site (GitHub Pages/Netlify) for a stable
Instagram-bio link; redeploy (or re-copy town.glb + world_state.json) after each grow.sh run.
It always shows the CURRENT town only (no time-travel yet). Usernames on houses are a
planned feature, not wired up — needs a `username` field added to buildings in
world_state.json first.

## Milestones (auto-built when population crosses)
500 fountain plaza | 2,000 skyscraper | 10,000 stadium

## Web viewer (Followville)
index.html = the landing/home page (logo, tagline, live day/population stats, "Walk the
town" button). town.html = the actual first-person walkable town (Three.js GLTFLoader);
town.glb = exported geometry. Landing page stats are pulled straight from world_state.json's
own `day`/`pop` fields on a ~45s poll — no calendar/date math anywhere, since day/pop should
ONLY change when the town is actually regrown via grow.sh, never on a timer. Population is
intentionally NOT derived from building count (a future apartment building could hold many
followers in one building) — always read `state.pop` directly, never `buildings.length`.
Logo image expected at logo.png next to index.html (falls back to an emoji if missing).

grow.sh auto-exports town.glb after every growth — generator and export_web.py MUST run in
the SAME blender invocation (--python a.py --python b.py). PITFALL (fixed, don't reintroduce):
the GUI City-panel Grow button saves the .blend including built objects; a separate export
launch would read that stale scene. Blend was purged + resaved clean on day 4.

PITFALL (fixed, don't reintroduce): export_web.py must jump to the animation's final frame
(scene.frame_set(scene.frame_end)) before realizing/exporting, or newly-risen houses can get
baked mid-rise ("pancaked" flat to the ground) — the daily rise animation scales buildings
from scale.z≈0.001 up to 1 over the clip, and export_apply=True bakes whatever frame is current.

## Files
neighborhood.blend (scene; GUI panel: N key -> City tab) | neighborhood_blender.py (generator)
grow.sh (CLI) | world_state.json (THE CITY) | renders/ (videos) | AI_HANDOFF.md (cheap-model manual)
world_state_*_backup.json = old test states, ignorable.
